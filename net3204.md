## Chapter Notes

### Chapter 1 - Characterization of DS

#### What is a distributed system?

> "A system in which kardware or software components located at **networked** computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by **message passing**. - _Coulouris_

> "A distributed system is a collection of **independent** computers **that appear** to the users of the system as a single computer." - _Tanenbaum_

> "A distributed system is one on which I **cannot get any work done** because some machine I have **never heard** of has **crashed**." - _Leslie Lamport_

#### Why Distributed Systems?

| Reason                               | Examples                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional separation**            | Clients and Servers, and data collection and processing                         |
| **Inherent distribution**            | Information, people, inventory systems, etc                                     |
| **Power imbalance & load variation** | Distribute load                                                                 |
| **Reliability**                      | data replication at different locations                                         |
| **Economics**                        | sharing reduces cost, building using common off-the-shelf components is cheaper |

| Concurrency                 | requires shared access to resources _(fair scheduling, preserve dependencies, avoid deadlocks)_                                                                                      |
| Distribution Transparency   | should be hidden from the user as much as possible _(access, location, failure, replication, migration, concurrency, performance, scaling, persistence, transactional transparency)_ |
| Quality of Service          | The quality of the distributed system through _reliability, security, performance, adaptablity_                                                                                      |

### Chapter 2 - System Models

#### Physical Models

- captures the **hardware composition** of a system in terms of computer hardware and interconnecting networks.
- model represents **underlying hardware** elements.
- **abstracts away** from specific details of the computer and networking technologies employed.
- is the **baseline** physical model: how hardware or software components located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their action by only passing messages.
- has 3 generations of distributed systems
  - Early distributed systems (1970s to early 1980s)
  - Internet-scale distributed systems
  - Contemporary distributed systems

#### Architectural Models

- discussions in terms of computational and communication tasks perform by its computational elements that are supported by appropriate network interconnections.
- is its structure in terms of separately specified components and their interrelationships
- major concerns are to make the system _reliable, manageable, adapatable, cost effective_
- three approaches: _architectural elements, architectural patterns, and architectural platforms_

#### Fundamental Model

- takes an abstract perspective to examine individual aspects of a distributed system. There are 3 important aspects

- **Interaction Model**
  - considers structure and sequencing of communication
- **Failure Models**
  - considers the ways how a system may fail to operate correctly
- **Security Models**
  - how the system is protected against attempts to interfere with proper operation

What factors limit the accuracy of the procedure you have described? How could the clocks in a large number of computers connected by the Internet be synchronized? Discuss the accuracy of that procedure.

    > Answer

3.  Consider the implementation strategies for massively multiplayer online games as discussed in Section 1.2.2. In particular, what advantages do you see in adopting a single server approach for representing the state of the multiplayer game? What problems can you identify and how might they be resolved?

    > Answer

4.  A user arrives at a railway station that they has never visited before, carrying a PDA that is capable of wireless networking. Suggest how the user could be provided with information about the local services and amenities at that station, without entering the station’s name or attributes. What technical challenges must be overcome?

    > Answer

5.  Compare and contrast cloud computing with more traditional client-server computing? What is novel about cloud computing as a concept?

    > Answer

6.  Use the World Wide Web as an example to illustrate the concept of resource sharing, client and server. What are the advantages and disadvantages of HTML, URLs and HTTP as core technologies for information browsing? Are any of these technologies suitable as a basis for client-server computing in general?

    > Answer

7.  A server program written in one language (for example, C++) provides the implementation of a BLOB object that is intended to be accessed by clients that may be written in a different language (for example, Java). The client and server computers may have different hardware, but all of them are attached to an internet. Describe the problems due to each of the five aspects of heterogeneity that need to be solved to make it possible for a client object to invoke a method on the server object.

    > Answer

8.  An open distributed system allows new resource-sharing services such as the BLOB object in Exercise 1.7 to be added and accessed by a variety of client programs. Discuss in the context of this example, to what extent the needs of openness differ from those of heterogeneity.

    > Answer

9.  Suppose that the operations of the BLOB object are separated into two categories – public operations that are available to all users and protected operations that are available only to certain named users. State all of the problems involved in ensuring that only the named users can use a protected operation. Supposing that access to a protected operation provides information that should not be revealed to all users, what further problems arise?

    > Answer

10. The INFO service manages a potentially very large set of resources, each of which can be accessed by users throughout the Internet by means of a key (a string name). Discuss an approach to the design of the names of the resources that achieves the minimum loss of performance as the number of resources in the service increases. Suggest how the INFO service can be implemented so as to avoid performance bottlenecks when the number of users becomes very large.

    > Answer

11. List the three main software components that may fail when a client process invokes a method in a server object, giving an example of a failure in each case. Suggest how the components can be made to tolerate one another’s failures.

    > Answer

12. A server process maintains a shared information object such as the BLOB object of Exercise 1.7. Give arguments for and against allowing the client requests to be executed concurrently by the server. In the case that they are executed concurrently, give an example of possible ‘interference’ that can occur between the operations of different clients. Suggest how such interference may be prevented.

    > Answer

13. A service is implemented by several servers. Explain why resources might be transferred between them. Would it be satisfactory for clients to multicast all requests to the group of servers as a way of achieving mobility transparency for clients?

    > Answer
